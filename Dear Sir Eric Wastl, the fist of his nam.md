Dear Sir Eric Wastl, the fist of his name, harbinger of impostor syndrome, bringer of cheer, santa's little helper,

It has come to my attention that you are in need of funds to continue your holiday endeavor, affectionately referred to as Advent of Code. Heretofore I would like to declare my intention in becoming a patron of your services. Please respond with detailed instructions on how I might bequeath a small parsonage onto thee.

With the greatest of holiday cheer, yours faithfully,

The Countess Melissa Jade Pulmones de Leon, first of her name, mother of corgis, producer of mediocre code, bard of the Bay, fan of Advent of Code.
